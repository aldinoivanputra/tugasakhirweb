Marvel had a good thing going with the Brand New Day era of Amazing Spider-Man. Rather than publish three discrete Spider-Man comics all vying for readers' attention, why not pool that creative talent and have them collaborate on one thrice-monthly book instead? That's basically the thinking with "No Surrender," a crossover that causes Avengers, U.S.Avengers and Uncanny Avengers to fold into one weekly Avengers comic over the next four months. As rudderless as this franchise has been of late, it helps bring a newfound sense of focus and drive to the table.

The Avengers #675 unfolds as a fairly straightforward introduction to this crossover. Earth is plagued by a series of natural disasters, forcing each and every Avengers team to band together to protect the millions of civilians in harm's way. Apart from one or two big moments, readers won't see much in this issue that wasn't already made apparent by the marketing push leading up to "No Surrender." It's all presented in an effective, immediate way, but the emphasis on carnage and spectacle prevents the writers from digging in very deep with any of the many characters headlining the story. The crossover will definitely need to unload a few curve-balls if readers are going to be compelling to stick around for 15 more chapters.The good news is that writers Mark Waid, Jim Zub and Al Ewing make for an effective team. This issue maintains a consistent voice and tone despite having so many writers on board, and it never reads like an obvious product of one writer over the others. And while this issue does struggle to make room for individual characters to shine through, it succeeds in giving readers a clear narrative focal point by casting the former Living Lightning as the lead protagonist. It'll be interesting to see how that character's arc unfolds over the course of these next four months.

As spectacle-driven as this opening issue is, at least artist Pepe Larraz is able to do justice to that spectacle. Larraz's pages are slickly rendered and ooze power and detail. An early splash image feature Falcon soaring against a New York City skyline is one of the issue's high points, but Larraz continues to impress throughout the issue. He juggles a hectic plot and massive cast deftly. The worst that can be said about the art is that David Curiel's colors don't always complement Larraz's pencils perfectly. Curiel is great about depicting glowing lights and displays of energy, but his skin tones are marked by an excessive, unnatural sense of lighting and contrast.
