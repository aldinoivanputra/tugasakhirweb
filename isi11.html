Whatever your thoughts on Captain America in the wake of Secret Empire, there's one thing all fans should be able to agree on - having Mark Waid and Chris Samnee on board the core Captain America series is a very good thing. Waid and Samnee have established themselves as one of the greatest creative teams working in comics today. And if Captain America #695 is any indication, we've got the makings of another modern classic on our hands.

There are a number of comparisons to be drawn between this new arc, "Home of the Brave," and the infamous "Superman: Grounded" storyline. In both cases, you have an iconic hero at a psychological low and dealing with a major blow to their reputation. Just as Superman did, Cap's method of dealing with his problems is to hit the road and get back in touch with the ordinary, everyday Americans he's charged himself with defending. It was a good pitch when writer J. Michael Straczynski attempted it back in 2010, but one that "Grounded" failed to properly utilize.

Fortunately, "Home of the Brave" tackles it with far more grace. Waid's script isn't preachy or jingoistic, and it reflects the emotional fallout of Secret Empire without getting bogged down in details or downplaying the innate heroism of Steve Rogers. It helps that this premise lends itself naturally to the sort of done-in-one storytelling Waid and Samnee have become known for. The format allows the duo to shift focus to a new town and a new challenge with each issue, while still slowly building up an overarching threat over time. It all makes for a very accessible gateway into the series, and one that captures so much of what makes Cap appealing in the first place. It's not as drastically different as, say, Ed Brubaker and Steve Epting's first Cap issue or Nick Spencer and Jesus Saiz's first Cap issue, but it's the sort of palate cleanser the character needed.
